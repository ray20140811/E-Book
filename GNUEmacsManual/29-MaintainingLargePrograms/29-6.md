# 29.6 Merging Files with Emerge

It’s not unusual for programmers to get their signals crossed and modify the same program in two different directions. To recover from this confusion, you need to merge the two versions. Emerge makes this easier. For other ways to compare files, see Comparing Files, and Ediff in The Ediff Manual.

對於程式設計師來說，出現信號交叉並在兩個不同的方向上修改同一個程式是很常見的。要從這種混亂中恢復，您需要合併這兩個版本。Emerge 可以讓這變得更容易。有關其他比較文件的方法，請參閱比較文件和 The Ediff Manual 中的 Ediff。

## 29.6.1 Overview of Emerge

To start Emerge, run one of these four commands:

M-x emerge-files ¶
	Merge two specified files.

M-x emerge-files-with-ancestor ¶
	Merge two specified files, with reference to a common ancestor.

M-x emerge-buffers ¶
	Merge two buffers.

M-x emerge-buffers-with-ancestor ¶
	Merge two buffers with reference to a common ancestor in a third buffer.

The Emerge commands compare two files or buffers, and display the comparison in three buffers: one for each input text (the A buffer and the B buffer), and one (the merge buffer) where merging takes place. The merge buffer shows the full merged text, not just the differences. Wherever the two input texts differ, you can choose which one of them to include in the merge buffer.

Emerge 命令比較兩個檔案或緩衝區，並在三個緩衝區中顯示比較結果：一個用於每個輸入文本（A 緩衝區和 B 緩衝區），以及一個（合併緩衝區）用於進行合併。合併緩衝區顯示完整的合併文本，而不僅僅是差異。在兩個輸入文本不同的地方，您可以選擇將其中之一包含在合併緩衝區中。

The Emerge commands that take input from existing buffers use only the accessible portions of those buffers, if they are narrowed. See Narrowing.

如果 Emerge 命令從現有緩衝區中取得輸入，並且這些緩衝區已經被縮小，則 Emerge 命令只會使用這些緩衝區的可訪問部分。請參閱「Narrowing」。

If a common ancestor version is available, from which the two texts to be merged were both derived, Emerge can use it to guess which alternative is right. Wherever one current version agrees with the ancestor, Emerge presumes that the other current version is a deliberate change which should be kept in the merged version. Use the ‘with-ancestor’ commands if you want to specify a common ancestor text. These commands read three file or buffer names—variant A, variant B, and the common ancestor.
